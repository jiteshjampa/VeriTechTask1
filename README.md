<p id="description">This project aimed to improve user experience on the Company Team Page by making it responsive across various devices. The goal was to maintain consistency and readability while ensuring optimal viewing on desktops laptops tablets and mobile phones. By analyzing the existing HTML and CSS code we identified elements requiring responsiveness and implemented CSS media queries for different screen widths. Flexible layouts image optimization and adjustments to content hierarchy were key strategies employed to achieve this.</p>
